# Deep-Q-Learning-Agent

*Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?*
In my project two, I was tasked with creating an intelligent agent capable of navigating its way through a maze in order to find the rewarding tile, or the end so to speak. I was given python code that layed out the structure of the game and the potential actions that the agent could perform, my specific task was to train the agent using Deep-Q Learning neural networks as well as using an epsilong greedy algorithm for it to make more valuable choices, which would result in a win for the agent. It would have to learn and run tests until it received a win rate of 100%. 

*What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?*
To my understanding, computer scientists observe problems within the real world and attempt to provide solutions through the means of technological solutions. 

*How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?*
I attempt to approach problems with logical thinking, similar to how a computer would. I essentially attempt to identify the problem and create solutions that would do so without creating a new one or at the expense of living life on the planet. It's essential to create a solution that doesn't create further complications down the line, but rather fixes the problem and any underlying, not so obvious problems, that could also be fixed.

*What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?*
My ethical responsibilities to the end user is to ensure that my solutions solve the problem without being at the expense of the user. My solutions should not possess any bias within it towards any one group of individuals. I also strive for transparency of my solutions to the end users, and prevent any form of "black box" models so that I can gain the trust of my users. For my organization, my solutions should be able to fix the problem without breaking the bank or violiting any data protection laws.
